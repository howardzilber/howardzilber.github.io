         <h2>Philosophy</h2>
         <p class="text">
             When I was in college I majored in philosophy. I also did my graduate work in philosophy. During that time some of the ideas that appear here began to form. But I knew I needed to study math and science, as well as get a better grounding in the history of philosophy before I could properly philosophize.
For many years I wrote mostly plays and musicals while doing the studying I thought I needed. In recent years, in part because much of that studying was done, and in part because of increasing awareness of mortality, I have started writing philosophy. I call the result, I hope not too grandly: Philosophical Essays and Excursions.
The essays are a bit more formal, the excursions sometimes even playful. The intended reader is not only trained philosophers but anyone who delights in thinking about the world.
I’ll add that though these pieces are intended to cohere as a whole –the work is still in progress- they are written so they can be read independently. As a result there is some repetition. But things worth saying are often worth repeating.
