        <h2>Poetry</h2>
        <p class="text">
             I was so used to writing dialogue, so used to speaking as other people that it required a kind of transition to writing something as personal as poetry. A Calligraphy of Bone started as the poetry of a particular fictional character. As the work proceeded it became more and more my own, but always with a bit of doubt about who exactly was writing.
From there I moved on to Sabbatical Sonnets. They are “sonnets” only in that they are fourteen lines. They are “sabbatical” because I did not seek them out but wrote them when they came. At some point fourteen-lined work stopped coming, to be replaced by poems with only four lines. Not wanting to be thought “square”, I called them Trapezoids.
Constraints were beginning to wear on me. I had written as someone else. I had poured my plaster into rigid molds. I yearned for a bit of freedom. The result was Working Free.
Currently I am working on three volumes: One Hundred-Eighty Droplets, Psalms, and Clothe Me in Your Nakedness and Other Poems. I look forward to sharing them when they are reader-ready.
I said I began by saying that my first poems were not in my own voice. Now I write more personally. However, I still find myself, at least some of the time, writing from perspectives I have only observed or imagined.
