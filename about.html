            <h2>Letter from The Artist</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Friends,<br>
                When I was very young, I read history and biography and was excited by politics. I wanted to help perfect the world through political action. But during my teenage years, it became obvious that my true interests and talents were intellectual and artistic. I formed a vague intention of being a writer.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In college, I studied philosophy, and in graduate school as well. I began to have ideas I wanted to develop, but I knew that to do so I needed to further educate myself and gather life experience.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The desire to write was still there. I assumed it would be fiction. But my early discarded stories were too self-conscious, idea-driven, and derivative. I read a book by Walter Kerr on the theatre that emphasized the mythic, larger-than-life quality of the best of drama. I was convinced.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Since then, I have written many plays and musicals. And when I manage to get them before an audience, they are very well received. Over the years, some poetry and childrenâ€™s stories sneaked in. In recent years, realizing that my philosophical ideas had matured, a clearer understanding of mortality nudged me into writing philosophy and Torah commentary.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                It may seem that I am writing too many things. I may be. But all the work I do, I feel compelled to do. I am much better at making work than marketing it, and I would much rather be at home writing than in a meeting. But I do not make my work just for me. I have a strong urge to share it with others. That explains why this website was created.
            </p>

                That said, please look, read, listen, and enjoy. Any helpful comments would be appreciated, as would opportunities for collaboration. I would especially appreciate any help that gets this work a bit further into the world.
            </p>

                I have two reasons I think I am here on earth: to be father to my daughter Zoey, and to make this work.<br><br>
                All blessings,<br>
